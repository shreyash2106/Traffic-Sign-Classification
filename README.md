# Traffic Sign Classification

Created a Flask app (website) where a user can upload a photo of a road sign and our neural network classifies it and outputs the type of traffic sign. We used a Convolutional Neural Network to classify the images. Our model ended up with an accuracy of approximately 94%.

To run the app, download the project and unzip the file. cd into the project directory and run the command "FLASK_APP=server.py flask run"
